Building a REST API
To build a RESTful JSON API with Express, we have to do the following:

-Implement the basic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) actions -using the appropriate HTTP methods.
-Respond with the correct status codes.
-Parse the HTTP request body, when necessary, and use it accordingly.
-Define routes that satisfy the REST constraints.
-Persist the data (in most cases, anyway).
